                    <p>A custom radio player for the new website redesign for Portland State University’s radio station. I used RadioCo’s DIY Radio builder kit as a starting point and created a WordPress template that implements RadioCo streaming functionality with a clean layout that matches the site’s new identity. The player opens in a separate browser window so music can play in the background without relying on an AJAX Wordpress template.</p>
