# George's Personal Site

Single-page web project to display some of my past work and give other people a little bit of info about me and my experience. Built in HTML, CSS & JavaScript using the Bootstrap framework. 

## Installation
1. Get repository URL by clicking 'Code' and copying the HTTPS link
2. Open your terminal on your computer, GitHub Desktop app or code editor with Github built in.
    - If using terminal, nagivate to the folder you wish to clone to, and then enter 'git clone [repo URL]'
    - If using a desktop app, carefully follow the app's instructions on how to clone a new repository from GitHub, and then open the project to view code
3. Once the repository has been cloned, you should be able to view the index.html file in your local browser by navigating to the repository folder and opening 'index.html' in the browser of your choice
